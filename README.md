# My Portfolio

Code for my personal profile page, currently live on [MattKilcup.dev](https://MattKilcup.dev). There is an updated list of projects that I have worked on, as well as contact information and my resume.

I completed the Full Stack Boot Camp in March 2019, and am currently looking for a job in development.
